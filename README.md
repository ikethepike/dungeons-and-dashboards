## Project Policies

__Feature Branching__ as a variety of features are present, and in order to better identify issues in tests, we rely on feature branching functions and fixes. Three main types:
- feature/xx
- fix/xx
- update/xx




### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
